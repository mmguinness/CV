## Marie Mc Guinness

Junior Software Developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy coding bootcamp. After spending ten years working in the Architecture industry, I have embarked on a new path to develop my coding skills to build something new.

The key skills I will bring to my new role include: creativity, problem solving, systems thinking, and experience in the design development process of bringing a project from beginning to end. I'm looking for a Junior Developer role in an agile team environment where I can develop my code craftsmanship and build simple, clean code with a company who are creative and impactful in their mission.

## Skills

#### Creative 
- Problem solving across all-scales - conceptual ideas down to small details
- I am a visual thinker, one of my favourite parts of Makers has been discovering a new type of diagram almost every week.  


#### Communication and Collaboration
- Developing briefs and interpreting what is required
- Collaboration with design team, consultants, clients and end-users
- Presentation skills 
```
Example: Communication was an integral part of my role as an Architect in Metropolitan Workshop, including presenting our work in public consultations. When Covid-19 prevented us from doing this in-person on the Cromcastle Court project in Dublin, after numerous iterations we provided a document, agreed with client and stakeholders, via website instead to help gain feedback from the local community.
