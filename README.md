Junior software developer and recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) coding bootcamp. After spending ten years working in the construction industry, I have embarked on a new path to develop my coding skills and build something new.

The expertise I developed as an architect that I hope to bring to my new role include creativity, problem solving, systems thinking, and experience bringing complex projects from beginning to end.

I'm looking for a junior software development role in an agile team where I can further develop my skill set and build simple, clean code with a company who are passionate about what they do.

## Tech Experience
