## Skills

#### Creative problem solver

- Problem solving across all-scales - conceptual ideas down to small details
- I am a visual thinker, one of my favourite parts of Makers has been discovering a new type of diagram almost every week. When stuck on a problem or short on time, I lean on diagramming and planning. For example in my [Chitter API](https://github.com/mmguinness/frontend-api-challenge) weekend challenge.

#### Strong verbal, visual and written communication

- Developing briefs with clients/end-users and interpreting what is required
- Collaboration with design team, consultants, building-contractors, stakeholders and end-users
- Presentation skills: visual communication of ideas and presenting this to others

#### Meticulous attention to detail

- Meticulous attention to detail - provide example
- Strive for efficeincy in design solution and workflows
