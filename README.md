## Marie Mc Guinness

I am (aiming to be) a full stack Ruby developer. I can bring ten years of experience as an Architect, working across multiple project stages & scales, a meticulous attention to detail in everything I do, and a daily practice of problem solving and strategising. While evolving my new technical skills as a software developer I am eager to apply my experience working with briefs, interpreting what is required and following a design-process of testing and collaboration to get the required result.

My career in architecture has given me insight into a creative and impactful industry. These are some of the aspects I am looking for in software development, I am excited about a new role where I can be involved hands-on with the work, away from the volatility and slow pace of the construction industry.

## Work Experience

**Metropolitan Workshop** (Nov 2019 to July 2021)  
_Senior Architect_

- I worked with a large multidisciplinary design team on a masterplan for a 3ha site in North Dublin. The masterplan includes 400 residential units plus some commercial and community uses. I worked with Metropolitan Workshop to develop Phase 1, which includes 150 units for planning application. This was a complex brief with the additional challenges of using modular systems of construction and which required a sensitive approach to the existing community on the site.
- QMS EMS Lead in Dublin office
- BIM Lead - I worked closely with the BIM coordinator in-office to help create office wide standards and templates for Autodesk Revit

**DTA Architects** (Aug 2017 to Oct 2019)  
_Architect_

- My role as Senior Architect involved leading the implementation of BIM in the office with the trial of a complex urban block project with Vectorworks 3D. I reached out to Vectorworks Support to help develop a system of files that would work for the large complex building to ensure we could extract the level of detail required. We produced a full set of Tender and Construction drawings, schedules & details from the 3D model. I was involved in all aspects of this project including design development, consultant coordination, and client and stakeholder meetings. 

**Satellite Architects** (Sep 2015 to Jul 2016)  
_Architect_

- Specialising in bespoke, design-led projects, Satellite Architects are committed to modern and sustainable design. 
- In my role as Architect I assisted with the development of tender information, including the development of construction detailing, internal finishes, product specification, and assisted with planning applications.


**Haverstock Architects** (Sep 2012 to Aug 2015)  
_Architectural Assistant_

- Haverstock works closely with clients, creating designs to meet their needs, and inspiring buildings to enhance peopleâ€™s lives.
- My role as Architectural Assistant involved working alongside the Project Architect for the duration of a project, including liaising with consultants, developing drawing packages, preparing regular client presentations, site inspections and planning & building control submissions.

## Skills

#### Creative 
- As an Architect, I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving and try to look at things from a new perspectives. From big urban scale ideas, to small brickwork details, I am always trying to bring creativity and joy to the details of a project.

#### Excellent Communicator 
- Communication was an integral part of my role as an Architect in Metropolitan Workshop, including presenting our work in public consultations. When Covid-19 prevented us from doing this in-person on the Cromcastle Court project in Dublin, after numerous iterations we provided a document, agreed with client and stakeholders, via website instead to help gain feedback from the local community.

#### Collaboration
Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for putting my head down to get the work done, or offering leadership. The move to working remotely in March 2020 involved me taking on a greater role as main contact for the client, stakeholders in the local council, the extended design team, and the internal team in the office. I also took up a mentorship role within the office to ensure architectural graduates were receiving the same level of exposure and experience to the work happening in the office while being unable to observe the everyday activity in the office.

#### Design development and management
I have four years experience in a senior role, working through projects, usually over a few years span, from sketch design to built form. This requires ongoing engagement with the client and design team, programming of work and review stages to keep the project on track. Design development is required throughout including research into products and construction techniques, testing the design and checking with building regulations on space standards, structural strategy, mechanical, electrical, acoustic and fire requirements.

#### Attention to detail
A key part of my role as Architect is reviewing and checking consultant information to ensure it is consistent with the design intention and coordinated with all other consultants' work. This work is demonstrated on the recent completion of a Staycity aparthotel by DTA Architects. I was responsible for the construction drawing packages, I contributed to the building specification documents and the coordination with the main building contractor and subcontractors on site.

#### Strive for efficiency
I took on a QMS and EMS role for the Dublin branch of Metropolitan Workshop in 2019 to help bring the office up to the same level as London, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification. This role involved creating, maintaining and reviewing quality and environmental management goals and documentation within the office. This happens through staff training, internal auditing and review of goals regularly. Following a two day external Audit in Feb 2021, we gained accreditation for the Dublin office.
